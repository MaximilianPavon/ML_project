\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

\textit{
Precise summary of the whole report, previews the contents and results. Must be a single paragraph between 100 and 200 words.
}

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

\textit{
Background, problem statement, motivation, many references, description of contents. Introduces the reader to the topic and the broad context within which your research/project fits
\begin{itemize}
\item What do you hope to learn from the project?
\item What question is being addressed?
\item Why is this task important? (motivation)
\end{itemize}
Keep it short (half to 1 page).

\section{Data analysis}
This competition is performed on two datasets, a training and a test dataset with $4.363$ resp. $6.544$ songs. Each dataset has a total of $264$ features, which will be used for predicting one of $10$ classes. The features con be grouped into the 3 main components of music: timbre, pitch and rhythm. The $10$ classes are:  Pop Rock, Electronic, Rap, Jazz, Latin, R\&B, International, Country, Reggae and Blues.

In order to better visualise the training data we performed the \textit{t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding} (\textbf{t-SNE}) with $3$ remaining dimensions. The result of this award-winning embedding is shown below:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{report_files/TSNE_data.png}
\end{center}

It is also important to know the distribution of the given training dataset. The distribution is shown in the following picture:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{report_files/Class_distribution.png}
\end{center}

This distribution shows very clearly that the training data is skewed, which means that the predictor will be able to generalise better for the majority classes.

%in case we need to fill more space we could add a boxplot of the 264 features.


%\textit{
%Briefly describe data (class distribution, dimensionality) and how will it affect classification. Visualize the data. Don’t focus too much on the meaning of the features, unless you want to.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Include histograms showing class distribution.
%\end{itemize}
%}

\section{Methods and experiments}

\textit{
Explain your whole approach (you can include a block diagram showing the steps in your process).
\begin{itemize}
\item What methods/algorithms, why were the methods chosen.
\item What evaluation methodology (cross CV, etc.).
\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Logistic Regression}

\subsection{Support Vector Machines}

\subsection{Naive Bayes}

\subsection{Neural Networks}
For this approach, we tried a fixed architecture of 5 layers with 100 to 200 units but different setting of hyper-parameters. 

\section{Results}

\textit{
Summarize the results of the experiments without discussing their implications.
\begin{itemize}
\item Include both performance measures (accuracy and LogLoss).
\item How does it perform on kaggle compared to the train data.
\item Include a confusion matrix.
\end{itemize}
}

We can see measurements of the methods chosen in Table~\ref{table:measurements}.
