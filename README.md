# Performance comparison on music genre classification for Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes classifiers and Neural Networks

In this project we explore different methods ranging from Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines to Naive Bayes classifiers and Neural Networks to tackle a simple Machine Learning problem.

We present different methods to model a music genre classification based on song features and discuss the implications that skewed classes have on the training process.

After that we show the results, which show that a model based on Logistic Regression is achieving both the highest accuracy as well as the lowest log loss.

We conclude that simple modelling is not sufficient enough and, albeit complicated, there are still opportunities for further improvement regarding performance.
